# üìò Publication Classification using the Google Gemini API

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`demo.ipynb`) that demonstrates how to classify academic publication PDFs using the **Google Gemini API**. The pipeline processes PDFs, applies classification using Gemini, and maps the output to predefined classes with optional error correction.

---

## üåê Setup: Google Gemini API Key

To use the Gemini API, you'll need to obtain an API key. Here's how:

### üîë Get Your API Key

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://cloud.google.com/)
2. Click **Console** (top-right corner)
3. Click **Select a Project** ‚Üí **New Project**
4. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com)
5. Click **Get API Key**
6. Save your API key securely (you‚Äôll insert it into the notebook)

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicsh-dtu/gemclass_demo.git
cd gemclass_demo
```

### 2. Create & Activate a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate         # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt     # Or run first notebook cell
```

### 4. Add Your API Key

Add your Gemini API-Key:

```yaml
api_key: "your-google-gemini-api-key"
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Never share/publish your key.


### 5. Add the folder 'Files', that contains subfolders (e.g. 'Project 1') with relevant PDF's.

## üìÑ Usage Instructions

1. Place your PDF files into the `Files/SUBFOLDERS` directory
2. Open `demo.ipynb` in JupyterLab or VS Code
3. Run through the cells:
   - Loads PDFs
   - Sends requests to Gemini API
   - Classifies the content based on `descriptions.yaml`
   - Applies filtering rules via `strings_to_check.yaml`
   - Corrects hallucinated class names via `wrong_classes.yaml`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

- **`descriptions.yaml`**  
  Define the possible classes and their descriptions. Gemini will use these descriptions to match publications.

- **`strings_to_check.yaml`**  
  Contains phrases that, if found in Gemini's output, cause the classification to be discarded.

- **`wrong_classes.yaml`**  
  Fixes hallucinated or incorrect class names by mapping them to valid ones.
